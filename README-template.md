## Overview

This project is a responsive testimonials grid section built as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge. The goal was to create a visually appealing layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes using modern CSS techniques. The component displays multiple user testimonials in a grid, emphasizing accessibility and clean design. It was a great opportunity to practice CSS Grid, Flexbox, and a mobile-first workflow, as well as to reinforce best practices in semantic HTML and component-based development.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I deepened my understanding of CSS Grid and Flexbox for building responsive layouts. I learned how to combine these techniques to create a flexible grid that adapts to different screen sizes. I also practiced using semantic HTML to improve accessibility and maintainability. Additionally, I gained experience with CSS custom properties, which made it easier to manage colors and spacing throughout the project.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on:

- Deepening my understanding of advanced CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts, especially for more complex responsive designs.
- Improving accessibility by learning more about ARIA roles and best practices for semantic HTML.
- Refining my use of CSS custom properties for better scalability and maintainability.
- Practicing performance optimization techniques, such as minimizing CSS and improving load times.
- Enhancing my workflow with better version control and automated testing tools.
- Continuing to study design systems and how to implement consistent UI patterns across projects.
